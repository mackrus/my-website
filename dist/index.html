      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm 26 years old, born in Stockholm, Sweden. I like cooking and traveling, a lot. I intend to study physics next fall, hence the incredibly nerdy theme
        (No, the orbits and their sizes and whatnot are <u>not</u> to scale, I tried but it didn't look very good
        so I had to shrink it down).
      </p>


      <p>
        I'm currently in Australia working to get some practical experience before I start working in an office. In my free time
        I try to learn about things.
        Most recently I've been learning about japanese knives, trying to understand what makes them so good. Another set of
        projects I have is writing code.
        Using python and PyTorch I've been trying to understand Speech Enhancement by training CNNs to make predicitons about
        speech quality in a non-intrusive way, specifically in terms of the Mean Opinion Score (MOS).
        You can read more about MOS <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08352.pdf">in the MOSnet paper</a>.
