      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm 25 years old. I like traveling a lot. I intend to study physics someday, hence the incredibly nerdy theme
        (No, the orbits and their sizes and whatnot are <u>not</u> to scale, I tried but it didn't look very good ðŸ˜•
        so I had to shrink it down).

      </p>

      <p>
        Sharks are my favorite animal and I like cooking. Maybe I should embed some cool stuff about sharks here?
      </p>

      <p>
        I think the government should make better websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is not a lot more to know about me, I'm a simple guy.
