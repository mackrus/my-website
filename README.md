### Solar System portfolio website

This project is a 3D simulation of the solar system built using Three.js. It features all the planets of the solar system, including the sun and the moon, with their respective orbits and rotations.

# Features

- Realistic 3D models of the planets with textures.
- Planets rotate around their own axis and orbit around the sun.
- The sun also rotates around its own axis.
- The moon orbits around the earth.
- The camera view can be controlled by the user to explore the solar system.
- The camera view changes as the user scrolls the page.
- Stars are randomly generated in the background to simulate the universe.

  
# How to Run

`python -m http.server`

Then, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.



# Libraries Used

- <a href="https://threejs.org">Three.js<a/>: A cross-browser JavaScript library used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
Future Improvements

- Add more celestial bodies like asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets.
- Improve the textures and models of the planets for a more realistic look.
- Add more details like the rotation and revolution speed of the planets.
- Add information about each planet that can be viewed by clicking on the planet.
